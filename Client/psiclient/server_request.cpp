/*
The purpose of ServerRequest is to wrap the various ways to make a HTTPS request
to the server, which will depend on what state we're in, what transports are 
available, etc.

Two design statements:

1. If a transport can connect without first making an extra-transport request,
   then it should.
    - In order to connect with VPN, an initial handshake is required in order to 
      get server credentials. So that doesn't qualify.
    - SSH and OSSH, on the other hand, do not, in theory, require an initial 
      handshake. So we will embed those credentials and then connect without an
      initial handshake.

2. Any extra-transport requests should try HTTPS (8080, then 443) and then fail
   over to setting up and making request through any available transports that
   don't require an extra-transport request to connect.
    - Failure requests, post-disconnect stats request, and VPN handshake requests
      all must be done extra-transport. Until now, those depended on HTTPS being
      available. This change will make it so that those requests succeed if HTTPS
      *or* SSH *or* OSSH are available.

Design assumptions:
- All transports will run a local proxy.
  - This is true at this time, but it's imaginable that it could change in the
    future. For now, though, when a transport is up we will alway route requests
    through the local proxy.

There are two basic states we can be in: 1) a transport is connected; 
and 2) no transport is connected. 

If a transport is connected, the request method is simple:
- Connect via the local proxy, using HTTPS on port 8080.

If a transport is not connected, the request method fails over among multiple
methods:

1. Direct to server
Connect directly with HTTPS. Fail over among specific ports (right now those
are 8080 and 443).

2. Via transport
Some transports (e.g., SSH) have all necessary connection information 
contained in their local ServerEntry; no separate handshake 
(i.e., extra-transport connection) is required to connect with these 
transports. If direct connection attempts fail, we will fail over to 
attempting to connect each of these types of transports and proxying our 
request through them.
